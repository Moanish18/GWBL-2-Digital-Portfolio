        <h2 class="reflection-title"><span class="reflection-icon">🧩</span>Nature of Work</h2>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          My work at Mandai Wildlife Group spanned technical automation development, creative content production,
          digital
          platform redesigns, and supporting organisation-wide innovation events. Each task required a distinct
          combination of
          technical depth, communication skills, and operational awareness.
        </p>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          A major responsibility was developing the <strong>Procurement RPA Bot</strong> which was an end-to-end
          automation that
          extracts RFQ/Tender data from Sesami, downloads files, classifies them, and uploads them into SharePoint.
          Beyond technical implementation, this involved gathering requirements, validating workflows, and ensuring that
          the
          bot aligned with the procurement team’s real operational constraints.
        </p>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          In parallel, I worked on <strong>MyProject100K video production</strong>, <strong>Transformation Office
            SharePoint redesign</strong>,
          <strong>Learning Festival content creation</strong>, and <strong>AI experimentation for Copilot 365</strong>.
          These responsibilities expanded
          my role beyond pure technical execution into communication, user experience design, and cross-department
          collaboration.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <strong>Key Insight:</strong> My role grew from “task executor” to a multidisciplinary contributor who
          connected
          technology, storytelling, and operational needs into cohesive solutions.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="reflection-section">
        <h2 class="reflection-title"><span class="reflection-icon">⚠️</span>Challenges Faced</h2>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          The most significant challenges emerged during the development of the Procurement RPA Bot. The Sesami portal
          UI
          changed frequently, resulting in broken selectors and unpredictable behaviour. Some vendors uploaded no
          documents,
          requiring me to design fallback logic that printed the web page as evidence instead.
        </p>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          Another challenge was balancing innovation with feasibility during the <strong>AI Agent Prototype</strong>.
          While technically exciting, the prototype required complex API orchestration and ongoing licensing costs.
          My supervisor and I eventually decided to discontinue the project.
        </p>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          Creative projects brought their own difficulties such as tight deadlines for video editing, coordinating
          filming with
          operational teams, and preparing AV systems for live events like the MyProject100K Ceremony and the Mandai
          Innovation Forum.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <strong>What I Learned:</strong> Challenges were not obstacles but signals as they revealed where my
          assumptions
          needed to be corrected, where the business needed clarity and where technically elegant solutions might not be
          operationally practical.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="reflection-section">
        <h2 class="reflection-title"><span class="reflection-icon">🌱</span>Learning & Growth</h2>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          Throughout the internship, I experienced significant growth in both technical capability and professional
          maturity.
          Completing the RPA Bot strengthened my skills in workflow design, exception handling, API-based file uploads,
          datatable manipulation, and UI resilience patterns.
        </p>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          My work with Copilot 365 expanded my understanding of prompt engineering and responsible AI deployment.
          Analysing hallucinations and studying information retrieval limitations helped me develop safer, more
          predictable
          prompt structures which will be a skill directly applicable to my future AI development work.
        </p>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          I also grew creatively. Filming and editing videos, designing SharePoint pages, and producing microsites
          improved my storytelling and communication skills. These skills proved essential when presenting updates to
          senior leadership, explaining automation logic to non-technical staff or running AV for organisation-wide
          events.
        </p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          <strong>Growth Mindset:</strong> I learned to iterate fast, document rigorously, communicate clearly and
          remain
          adaptable even when projects shifted direction.

        <h2 class="reflection-title"><span class="reflection-icon">🏆</span>Accomplishments</h2>

        <p class="reflection-text">
          Across Weeks 16–33, I delivered multiple high-impact outcomes:
        </p>

        <ul class="reflection-list">
          <li><strong>Completed the Procurement RPA Bot</strong> with full documentation, demos, and successful
            handover.</li>
          <li><strong>Produced five MyProject100K videos</strong> showcased during the organisation’s award ceremony.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Redesigned the Transformation Office SharePoint site</strong> to improve usability and branding.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Created the Learning Festival microsite</strong> and a full AEIOU recap newsletter + video.</li>
          <li><strong>Supported AV operations</strong> for the MyProject100K Ceremony & Mandai Innovation Forum.</li>
          <li><strong>Attended industry events</strong> (Databricks Expo, AWS Tech Talk, Data Engineering Workshop) to
            expand my professional knowledge.</li>
          <li><strong>Received approval from Deputy CEO</strong> to provision a VM & unattended bot licence for RPA
            deployment.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
          These achievements demonstrate not just technical skill, but initiative, ownership, collaboration and the
          ability
          to contribute meaningfully to real organisational needs.
