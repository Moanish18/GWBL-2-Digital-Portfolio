        <h2 class="project-title">🌟 Final Reflection</h2>
        <p class="project-desc">
          This internship became a defining chapter in my journey, not because of any single project, but because it
          revealed
          the kind of technologist I want to become. I learnt that building solutions is not just about technical
          accuracy;
          it is about responsibility, clarity, empathy, and the courage to question how things should work instead of
          accepting
          how they currently do. Working across automation, GenAI experimentation, workflow mapping and digital
          storytelling,
          pushed me to blend analytical thinking with creativity and technical execution with human understanding. It
          showed me
          that impactful innovation only happens when technology is paired with intention.
        </p>

        <p class="project-desc">
          More importantly, this internship gave me a sense of direction I never had before. I leave Mandai with a
          sharper
          awareness of the problems I feel called to solve and empower people. I now understand the systems I want to design, the values I want to
          uphold,
          and the type of impact I want my work to create. This experience did not simply build my skills; it grounded
          my identity
          as a technologist and set the foundation for the career I want to pursue with purpose and confidence.
